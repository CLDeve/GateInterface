[2b. Planning #135] The system must have an alert function to inform officers who are underutilized or overutilized. According to officer contracts, groups of officers need to meet a minimum contractual working hours per month. The system should generate reports comparing officers' upcoming deployment with their available status versus the working hours achieved. Additionally, a dashboard should flag any discrepancies.
[2b. Planning #136] The system must be capable of managing mass roster changes, such as when a site is dismounted, officers are redeployed to another assignment, or there is a change in shift patterns.
[2b. Planning #137] The system must be capable of identifying when a roster needs to be regenerated due to changes in allowance, coverage, or demand location. For example, while a change in allowance may not necessitate regeneration, a change in shift pattern would require the roster to be regenerated.
[2b. Planning #138] The system must have a logic for equal overtime allocation during rostering. For example, in a monthly roster run with 69 hours of overtime, the system should distribute the overtime equally across the roster. Moving forward, the system should also consider optimizing shift hours or shift patterns.
[2b. Planning #140] Overtime Alert System: Once the roster is generated, the system should be capable of sending alerts to available officers to perform overtime and cover any planned shortfall. This includes automatically prompting officers, especially part-timers, for job bidding.

Shortfall Detection and Notification: The system should detect any shortfall and send notifications to qualified staff to fill the job.
Outcome-Based Reminders: The system should provide reminders about the shortfall specifically for part-timers.

[2b. Planning #196] The NGRS system will utilize AI to consolidate all planned and actual day shortfall data based on the final reconciled roster. It will then automatically send the final shortfall status to the Management Staff
[2b. Planning #199] The system should feature a Digital Twin with AI capabilities to propose optimal shift schedules. This will dynamically adjust the roster to prevent over or under-utilization
[2b. Planning #200] The system should have AI enabled feature to assist in optimizing team rotations
[2b. Planning #202] The system should be AI-enabled to track officer arrivals at sites using various peripherals/systems. For example, in the case of APO deployment, an alternative method to determine an officer's location could be tracking their firearms
[2b. Planning #205] The system should be AI-enabled to provide predictive analysis by analyzing previous year data for comparison and recommendations (e.g., manpower, duty posts, absences). It should propose alternative roster and deployment plans during festive periods to minimize shortfalls and recommend the ideal number of Certis Resource Partners required to mitigate the shortfall
[2b. Planning #207] The system should feature AI capabilities to identify available and qualified officers and propose alternative rostering and deployment options during peak periods to minimize operational disruptions to existing permanent operations. It should also include a Cost Benefit Analysis for the different options within the BU to fulfill the requirement
[2b. Planning #209] The system should feature an AI-enabled chatbot to provide answers and follow-up actions required by officers, such as queries on payroll, deployment, and rostering matters.
[2b. Planning #211] The system should feature an error detection mechanism with a notification system to alert officers about attendance discrepancies, such as those identified after end-of-shift checks
[2b. Planning #213] Roster optimisation able to indicate or flag requirement for posting prioritisation(System to detect the holding officer pool vs assignment for upcoming posting /recruitment)
[2b. Planning #220] The system should support the attempt time to be capture from Time attendance system will be available when the roster is updated within N hour. Validation of geo-location of the roster should be supported. When the roster is insert N hour, the backfill  of the attempt time will be inserted as clock-in/out time as reconciliation.
[2b. Planning #223] The system should support integration between Cadence and rostering and allow certain feature as booking of shift , swap feature and change of work to off or cancellation of shift. Data should be sync between the 2 platforms
[2b. Planning #224] The system should allow manual sync from Roster to Cadence, this should also include the porting of any assigned officer's ID and the associated constraints/allowances that were created
[2b. Planning #225] The system should automatically align betwen billable time with planned internal demand to minimize the need for manual entries (if there is no clock in/out for split roster, system should recognise multiple roster to confirm the time attendance)
[2b. Planning #226] The system should support NGRS Sliding Window adjustments, enabling the creation of demand or rosters within 7 days and the insertion of officers 7 days post-deployment (affliated with 301)
[2b. Planning #227] The system should be capable of setting demand tolerance based on employee type. For example, part-time and full-time employees may share the same demand roster. This feature aims to reduce manual amendments in job confirmation by allowing the system to identify tolerance by employee type
[2b. Planning #229] The system should include a logic check validation of the roster hours for officer when a user attempts to book a training. For example, a message should pop up to block the user from creating the booking if a violation has occurred. The violiation message should appear clearly on the error details. Report to be available to retieve the error of booking and details.
[2b. Planning #230] The system should automatically send reminder emails to users when roster is nearing expiration to reduce the need for manual billing (email and configuable recipents), exclusion by Planner group, work item level, demand item.

This plan should involve daily pushes of MRS/SAP details to SharePoint or email. The BCP should cover the following: a) Monthly Roster b) Off day counter - to guard against 12 consecutive days c) Achieved vs Maximum Hours - to guard against 72 hours breach, 35 hours breach, and D10 rule d) Officer Qualification e) Demand Constraint"
[2b. Planning #239] The system should send notifications for any internal/ roster demand that has been created with apparoval workflow.
[2b. Planning #240] The system should allow users to view the full roster of one/more officer on one page, featuring a new UI/UX for roster view. (view/ download by groups)
[2b. Planning #249] The system should allow the bypassing of hard constraints via the manage roster constraints toggle for a single requested officer ID, rather than unlocking all demand items for the day.
[2b. Planning #250] The system should ensure that the maximum allowable payable hours for flexi shifts is 12 hours after meal breaks. If officers have multiple short shifts in a day without at least an 8-hour break between them, SAP HR will not deduct any meal breaks, which could risk exceeding the 12-hour limit. Additionally, the maximum allowable roster hours should be configurable by employee group. The flexi roster should also include at least a 1-hour interval between each shift if there is more than one shift per day, configurable at the plant level
[2b. Planning #251] The system should define MC as applicable for 24 hours of the day and replace it with 11 hours (Scheme A) or 8 hours (for other schemes) of paid hours as per regulations. This logic should not be incorrectly applied to night shift rosters where shift timings span across two days. Additionally, the system should prevent the incorrect deletion of training or adhoc deployment attendance upon the insertion of MC status
[2b. Planning #252] The system should allow for post-deployment fencing and prompt a pop-up message to alert operations when removing an officer who has already clocked in and out via Titus
[2b. Planning #253] The system should include a daily auto-rostering feature, primarily for new staff joining from CCU to BU. It should target officers who join the company in the middle of the month, identify those who are still under available status, and automatically roster them into demand
[2b. Planning #255] The system should automate the generation of missing daily rosters. If a daily roster is missing due to demand creation during backend scheduling, the system should automatically generate it
[2b. Planning #257] The system should have Report for comparation between Titus and rostering system on available and absent status e.g. TITUS record have been captured however the roster could be deleted and therefore the report will need to reflect the discrepancy
[2b. Planning #259] The system should allow setting individual expiration dates for coverage, constraints, and shift patterns. Additionally, it should include expiration dates for demand details
